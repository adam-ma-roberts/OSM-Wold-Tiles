# OSM-Wold-Tiles
The first few zoom levels of Open Street Maps world tiles.

These tiles where created with Maparative using the Open Street Maps data.

I am sharing these here as due to the OSM Tile Server's rate limiting (about 3 tiles a second).

It takes days to create these first few layers, as they do not change very often (continental drift, new civilization ... ) and to help reduce the load on the OSM Tile Servers.

I (and i assume others) will wanted to be able to access them quicker with out having to wait days for the OSM Tile Server, do not need up to the minuet data for the first few zoom levels.

They are not a great deal of data together, but they are quite important.
